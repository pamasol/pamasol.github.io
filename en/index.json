Go ahead, sign up for a trial apprenticeship and you’ll get a first-hand experience of the fascinating world of engineering - starting with mechanical processing and assembly, through wiring of electrical components all the way to pneumatic controls and software engineering.\nThe upper picture shows a Pamasol employee testing a Macromat LB20. This is a filling and sealing machine for spray cans. While the polymechanics and metal workers are working on the mechanic and metalwork, the automation engineer mounts all the electrical components such as sensors, motors and the big touchscreen. Afterwards, the PLC (that’s the computer and thus the brain of the machine) gets programmed to bring life to the machine.\nAs soon as the machine is running and the customer finished his checklist, it will be shipped to the production site, for example Australia, the US or Brasil, but also Germany or Switzerland. Pamasol machines are located all around the world, producing billions of spray cans.\nFully trained automation engineers have the opportunity to visit different countries and cultures, because the machines scattered around the world are installed and serviced by Pamasol employees on site.\nYou probably haven’t noticed it, but you definitely had a spray can in your hand that was filled on a Pamasol machine (deodorant, color spray, oven cleaner, shaving cream, room spray, silicone spray, oil spray, …the list goes on and on).\nA few answers to frequently asked questions:\nIs an automation engineer a demanded profession? Yes, automation engineers are professions in high demand and will continue to be in the future.\nMore and more tasks and operations are done by machines and robots.

These control cabinets can be the size of a shoebox, but also as big as four big closets put together.\nThe cabinets are filled with complex electronics, which are connected with wires. If one the hundreds of wires is connected incorrectly, the whole machine won’t work. In the worst case, parts could get damaged or destroyed, some of them costing as much as a car.\nBecause of this, full concentration and attention is needed when drawing these schematics. Work like this needs practice - and that’s exactly what we are doing with this excercise.\nDrawing schematics with Capital™ Electra™ X In a professional workspace schematics are drawn on programs such as EPLAN P8, Zucken E3 or WS-CAD\nFor the following project we recommend using the easy-to-use CAD Capital™ Electra™ X from Radica Software and Siemens. The basic functions, all of them free to use, cover everything needed for the occasional use. Additionally, you don’t need to install any software since it runs on your internet browser.\nCreate an account On radicasoftware.com/app/login you can sign up to get access to the drawing editor.\nStandards for drawing schematics How you draw a schematic and especcially how the symbols need to look is standardized. This has the advantage of having schematics which look the same all over the world and being easy to read for professional electricians.\nThe standard for these symbols is called IEC 60617. The most relevant symbols are found on wikipedia under the following links:\nGeneral symbols (only in german) Electrics/electronics (german, french, spanish) Measure and control technology (only in german) Don’t worry, you won’t need to know all of these from the beginning. There’s plenty of time during the apprenticeship.\nExcercises Info The schematic with the excercises can be imported here as a Capital™ Electra™ X template. If you don’t want to work online with Capital™ Electra™ X can download the PDF here.\nAll excercises are built in the same style. On the top left corner is a description with recommended parts. The 24VDC potential is drawn too. On the top is the plus, on the bottom the minus.\nThe parts can be placed between plus and minus. Following is the excercise 1 as an example.\nTemplate excercise 1\nSample solution excercise 1\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Control cabinet plug board","uri":"/en/trial-apprenticeship/plugboard/index.html"},{"content":"Let a software engineer check your machine remotely Most Pamasol machines are equipped with a secure industrial remote access device. In many cases it is a blue colored unit with the label “EWON” or “VIPA” that can be found in the main control cabinet. The following picture shows the modem which acts as a VPN router.\nLocate this device in your control cabinet and provide internet connection via Ethernet cable if it hasn’t been done already. The RJ45 cable with internet connection needs to be connected to port number 4, which is the WAN port, as shown below.\nSome modems come with a 2 position knob rotary switch, where internet access can be switched on and off hardware wise. Check if it is switched on.\nFollowing LEDs need to light green:\nPWR = Steady green USR = Blinking green slowly T2M = Steady green @ = Steady green The image below shows a modem that connected successfully. There is an internet connection (@) and it was able to register at the server (T2M). The orange LED below the RJ45 port lights up constantly whereas the green LED lights up almost all the time (short interruptions that visualize the communication).\nFirewall settings Typically, your IT department needs to do nothing for using the modem. The VPN tunnels are initiated by the router and use only outgoing connections. No incoming connections are made, so no ports need to be enabled in your corporate firewall for incoming connections. In addition, it is designed to be minimally intrusive by using outgoing ports that are usually already enabled (HTTPS port 443 or UDP port 1194).\nSee also the PDF-file “FAQ - Remote Access” for further explanation.\nInfo If there are any connection issues (and therefore T2M does not light), it is reccomeneded, whitelisting URL *.talk2m.com by your IT department.\nTip If the IT department does not provide internet connection via company network, a GSM modem can be used as well. In this case the company network and the machine are strictly separated.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Remote servicing","uri":"/en/support/remote-connection/index.html"},{"content":"Getting best customer support The machine is down, red LEDs everywhere (or nowhere), operators and managers are looking at you, expecting to fix the issue in no time.\nAt such a moment it is important to remain calm, analyze the situation and if necessary, contact the product support or after-sales team of the machine manufacturer.\nThis chapter describes how to get efficient and quick support by Pamasol After-Sales.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Support","uri":"/en/support/index.html"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","uri":"/en/categories/index.html"},{"content":"Pamasol Electrics Portal Info This website is maintained by employees and trainees at Pamasol Willi Mäder AG who are addicted to automation and technology.
