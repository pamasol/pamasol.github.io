At first the Pick&amp;amp;Placer is retracted and the conveyor is not running The operator places a container on the conveyor at the inlet light barrier 100BG1 and presses the button Start. The container gets transported to the separator and stops there The Pick&amp;amp;Placer moves down, sucks a lid from the magazine, moves up and to the front and down again on top of the container.</description></item><item><title>Brief overview TIA V16</title><link>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/brief-overview/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/brief-overview/index.html</guid><description>How the development environment TIA Portal is structured To program a PLC, you need a laptop which has the PLC programming software - in technical jargon development environment - installed.
The Pick&amp;amp;Place robot is equipped with a Siemens PLC which is programmed with the development environment TIA Portal. TIA is short for «Totally Integrated Automation». More information regarding this software can be found on the Siemens website.
The video explains the user interface with the views Portal view and Project view.</description></item><item><title>Create a new project</title><link>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/create-project/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/create-project/index.html</guid><description>The PLC hardware configuration as a basis As a first step a new PLC project will be created in the projec view. Afterwards you need to project the installed PLC from the control cabinet in the software. This will be done with the hardware configuration.
The Pick&amp;amp;Place robot is equipped with a SIMATIC ET200 CPU. Additionally input and ouptut modules will be added and configured.
Articel no° of the CPU for the hardware config Control CPU 1512SP F-1 PN: 6ES7512-1SK01-0AB0 Safety input ET200SP F-DI 8x 24V DC HF: 6ES7136-6BA00-0CA0 Safety output ET200SP F-DQ 8x 24V DC/0.</description></item><item><title>Set module parameters</title><link>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/set-plc-module-parameters/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/set-plc-module-parameters/index.html</guid><description>Configuring central processing unit (CPU) und IOs The modules in the device configuration are named identically as the ones in the electrical diagram. Afterwards, the address range can be assigned in the property window. Alternatively, you can open the view Device view &amp;gt; Device overview. All modules and address ranges are listed in table here.
The BaseUnits of the input and output modules come in light gray and dark gray. The light gray modules are powered with 24VDC.</description></item><item><title>Set HMI parameters</title><link>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/set-hmi-parameters/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/set-hmi-parameters/index.html</guid><description>4 inch touch panel Siemens KTP400 Comfort HMI stands for Human-Machine Interface. This is the touch panel, with which the operator controls the machine.
Add the HMI under Devices &amp;gt; Devices and networks. It is the KTP400 Comfort panel from Siemens with the type number 6AV2124-2DC01-0AX0.
Profinet stands for Process Field Network. It is a common protocol in the industry which uses TCP/IP Standards As such, the communication between PLC and HMI works similar to the internet (IP stands for Internet Protocol).</description></item><item><title>PLC simulation</title><link>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/simulation-with-plcsim/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/simulation-with-plcsim/index.html</guid><description>Emulate CPU and HMI for tests without hardware With the help of SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM the Pick&amp;amp;Place control can be simulated and tested without any hardware components added.
The video shows the simulation of the PLC and the touch panel. Emulating means recreating the functions of a computer with another device.
To be able to emulate a PLC or an HMI, you need to select the component in the Project navigator under Devices and click on the icon Start simulation in the smybol menu.</description></item></channel></rss>
