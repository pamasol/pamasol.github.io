At first the Pick&amp;amp;Placer is retracted and the conveyor is not running The operator places a container on the conveyor at the inlet light barrier 100BG1 and presses the button Start. The container gets transported to the separator and stops there The Pick&amp;amp;Placer moves down, sucks a lid from the magazine, moves up and to the front and down again on top of the container.</description></item><item><title>Brief overview TIA V16</title><link>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/brief-overview/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/brief-overview/index.html</guid><description>How the development environment TIA Portal is structured To program a PLC, you need a laptop which has the PLC programming software - in technical jargon development environment - installed.
The Pick&amp;amp;Place robot is equipped with a Siemens PLC which is programmed with the development environment TIA Portal. TIA is short for «Totally Integrated Automation». More information regarding this software can be found on the Siemens website.
The video explains the user interface with the views Portal view and Project view.</description></item><item><title>Create a new project</title><link>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/create-project/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pamasol.github.io/en/pick-n-place-project/create-project/index.html</guid><description>The PLC hardware configuration as a basis As a first step a new PLC project will be created in the projec view. Afterwards you need to project the installed PLC from the control cabinet in the software. This will be done with the hardware configuration.
The Pick&amp;amp;Place robot is equipped with a SIMATIC ET200 CPU. Additionally input and ouptut modules will be added and configured.
Articel no° of the CPU for the hardware config Control CPU 1512SP F-1 PN: 6ES7512-1SK01-0AB0 Safety input ET200SP F-DI 8x 24V DC HF: 6ES7136-6BA00-0CA0 Safety output ET200SP F-DQ 8x 24V DC/0.</description></item></channel></rss>
